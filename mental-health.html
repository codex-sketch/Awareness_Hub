            Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

            Mental health refers to a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. 
            It affects how we think, feel, and act in daily life. It also determines how we handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. 
            Maintaining good mental health is essential for overall health and quality of life.

    <h2>Neurodivergence</h2>
    <p>
        <span style="color: var(--gold); font-weight: bold;">Neurodivergence</span> describes the natural variations in the way people's brains function, process information, and perceive the world. 
        It includes conditions such as <span style="color: var(--teal); font-weight: bold;">Autism</span>, 
        <span style="color: var(--teal); font-weight: bold;">ADHD</span>, and <span style="color: var(--teal); font-weight: bold;">dyslexia</span>. 
        These differences can influence how individuals think, learn, or respond to certain situations, 
        but they are not flaws or choices — they are part of a person’s unique neurological makeup. 
        Recognizing neurodivergence helps foster <span style="color: var(--gold); font-weight: bold;">understanding</span>,

    <h2>The Brain & Neurodivergence</h2>
    <p>
        The human brain is made up of different regions, each responsible for specific functions. 
        <span class="tooltip">prefrontal cortex
            <span class="tooltiptext">The front part of the brain involved in decision-making, planning, and self-control.</span>
        </span> helps with decision-making, planning, and self-control, 
        while the <span class="tooltip">amygdala
            <span class="tooltiptext">A small region in the brain that processes emotions such as fear and anxiety.</span>
        </span> is involved in processing emotions like fear and anxiety. 
        Neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers in the brain, play a major role in regulating mood and behavior. 
        For example, <span class="tooltip">dopamine
            <span class="tooltiptext">A neurotransmitter that affects motivation, reward, and attention.</span>
        </span> affects motivation and attention, 
        <span class="tooltip">serotonin
            <span class="tooltiptext">A neurotransmitter that influences mood, social behavior, and well-being.</span>
        </span> influences mood and social behavior, and 
        <span class="tooltip">norepinephrine
            <span class="tooltiptext">A neurotransmitter that helps regulate alertness, arousal, and the stress response.</span>
        </span> helps with alertness and stress response. 
        In neurodivergent individuals, the brain may process information, regulate these chemicals, or activate certain regions differently. 
        This can influence emotions, learning styles, focus, and social interactions, highlighting the unique ways neurodivergent brains experience the world.

        <h3>What is Autism?</h3>
        <p>
            Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how a person perceives the world, communicates, and interacts with others. 
            Individuals with autism may experience differences in social interaction, communication, sensory processing, and behavior patterns. 
            Autism is a spectrum, which means its characteristics range from mild to more pronounced, and every autistic person has a unique combination of strengths and challenges.

            <li><strong>Asperger’s Syndrome</strong> – difficulties with social interaction and restricted interests, usually with normal or above-average intelligence; milder symptoms.</li>
            <li><strong>PDD-NOS (Atypical Autism)</strong> – some but not all traits of classic autism; severity varies.</li>
            <li><strong>Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD)</strong> – rare; typical development followed by significant loss of skills; more severe.</li>

    <h2>24 Hours in Thomas's Life</h2>
    <p>Thomas is 11 years old, tall for his age, and autistic. Let’s walk through a day in his life and see how he experiences the world.</p>

    <!-- Morning -->
    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>7:00 AM – Waking Up</h3>
        <p>
            Thomas wakes up to the sound of his alarm. Loud noises sometimes startle him, so he puts on his headphones. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="Thomas is sensitive to sound, a common trait for autistic children.">This helps him feel calm.</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>7:30 AM – Breakfast</h3>
        <p>
            At breakfast, Thomas likes his food in a specific order on the plate. If the cereal touches the toast, he gets anxious. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="Many autistic children have sensory preferences or routines.">These small routines help him feel safe.</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- School -->
    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>8:30 AM – School Begins</h3>
        <p>
            Thomas walks into class. He’s taller than most kids, so he often stands out. When someone takes his pencil, he goes quiet. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="He may feel overwhelmed and needs a moment to process.">This quiet moment is his brain managing emotions.</span>
            He doesn’t shout or get angry, but internally he’s working through frustration.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>10:00 AM – Recess</h3>
        <p>
            During recess, Thomas prefers lining up the small toys instead of running around. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="He may enjoy structured play and find large social groups overwhelming.">This is how he feels safe and engaged.</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>12:00 PM – Lunch</h3>
        <p>
            Thomas sits quietly eating his sandwich. He notices the way others interact but may not join immediately. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="Social interactions can be challenging for autistic kids.">He observes first, then decides if he wants to join in.</span>

    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>2:00 PM – Math Class</h3>
        <p>
            Thomas loves patterns and numbers. When the teacher gives a tricky problem, his eyes light up. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="Many autistic children have special interests and excel in certain subjects.">Math is one of his strengths.</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>3:30 PM – End of School</h3>
        <p>
            On the way home, Thomas prefers walking alone for a few minutes, listening to music. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="He may need quiet time to recharge after a busy day.">This helps him process everything that happened.</span>
        </p>

    <!-- Evening -->
    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>5:00 PM – Homework</h3>
        <p>
            Thomas sits at his desk with everything organized just right. If someone moves his notebook, he pauses for a second, takes a deep breath, and continues. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="Routine helps him feel in control and focused.">This is part of his coping strategy.</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>7:00 PM – Dinner</h3>
        <p>
            Dinner with family is loud, but Thomas uses a quiet corner to eat comfortably. He might hum or rock slightly while eating — a self-soothing behavior. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="Repeating movements or sounds can help autistic children regulate emotions.">It helps him feel safe and calm.</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Night -->
    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>8:30 PM – Relaxation</h3>
        <p>
            Thomas reads a book about space. He loves facts and visual stories. Sometimes he reads the same page twice — not because he forgot, but because it feels comforting. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="Repetition can be calming and enjoyable for autistic children.">This is part of his sensory enjoyment.</span>
        </p>

    <div class="mini-box">
        <h3>9:30 PM – Bedtime</h3>
        <p>
            Thomas prepares for bed in his exact routine: pajamas, brushing teeth, arranging stuffed animals. Any change can make him anxious, so he follows his steps carefully. 
            <span class="tooltip" title="Routines provide predictability and comfort.">This helps him sleep peacefully.</span>

            ADHD is often noticed in childhood but can continue into adolescence and adulthood.
